### Overview
This is an insightful code to understand the basics of how Neural Networks actally work?
How awesome they are, and how easy it is to implement them just by using vanilla python and NOTHING else!

### Motivation
To me Neural Network designing was analogous to Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch but when I saw that it is possible to design Neural Networks from scratch and that too using just vanilla python, I got so excited!!
This was my motivation behind going a step further and explore how to do it.
Seriously, now I have a better understanding of what is behind all these complex frameworks.

### Technical Aspect
Tech Stack include Python (version - 3.x), basics of Neural Networks and Digital Logic.

### Run
Simply run the jupyter notebook attached, to get the full insight of the project.
Go ahead and play with the values of learning rate (eta) and number of epochs/ iterations to get the feel of how Neural Networks actually LEARN!!

### Technologies Used
Tech Stack includes Python (version - 3.x), basics of Neural Networks and Digital Logic (AND, OR) (although any set of inputs and output world work - better if you can validate the results yourself :D).
